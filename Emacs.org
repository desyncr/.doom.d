* Forewords
This [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate]] Emacs configuration is based off [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]. It differs in how the configuration is organised. Most literate configurations are composed of a single [[http://orgmode.org/][Org]] file that is tangled into a =.el= file. I quickly found that approach difficult to maintain and work with, quickly approaching Emacs Bankruptcy.

#+begin_quote
Note: Most of the configurations here are copy/pasted from the package repositories README.md or other sources. I added attribution/source wherever possible.
#+end_quote

My approach to configuration organisation is to split into logical units that can be updated independently. This means both the source configuration (org file) and the output (elisp file) are maintained independendly from one unit to the other. Ideally it should be easier to work with this approach by having less lines of code per file and having files enforcing organisation.

But first let's start with an obligatory screenshot:
#+attr_org: :width 800
[[./resources/preview.png]]

This configuration is organised in a variety categories (see Organisation for details). This forces me to segregate configuration into files (per category) and keep the over all length of these to a level I'm comfortable with.

** How it works
The current file you're reading (=Emacs.org=) is tangled into =config.el=, this file is loaded by Doom Emacs on start up. The section down below is responsible for loading the individual section's tangled file, in turns this loads the entire configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/general.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/ui.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/fonts.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/keybindings.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/writing.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/coding.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/version-control.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/project-management.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/org-everything.el")
(load "~/.config/doom/.elisp/other.el")
#+end_src

=TODO=: Test loading =.el= files [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/7605][via glob]]. Ideally it should not cause any problem, /but/ some keybindings might be overwritten here and there.

Doom Emacs loads =init.el= from the user's configuration directory (=~/.config/doom/=). This file is responsible for activating Doom Emacs modules.

In order to tangle the different sections you'll need to run the following command:

#+begin_src sh :tangle no
$ ~/.emacs.d/bin/org-tangle ~/.config/doom/config
#+end_src

Alternatively you can use the =make= command to tangle your configuration intelligently and additionally run =doom sync=.

The command above will tangle the Org files in the user's directory. The sections define the output's location via property headers such as:

#+begin_example
#+property: header-args :tangle .elisp/general.el
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
WARNING: Each category file has property headers indicating the tangle's output file. Using =:tangle yes= in src blocks inside the files will cause the output file to be overwritten by the single block.
Instead simply use begin_src / end_src without =:tangle=.
#+end_quote

** Prerequisites
This is a list of applications that need to be installed previously to enjoy all the goodies of this configuration.

- ag (Silver Searcher) or rg (ripgrep)
- git
- make

See [[file:config/version-control.org][Doom Emacs > Version Control]].

This configuration also requires two fonts that will require to be installed in the system to properly load the Look and Feel:
- JetBrains Nerd Font
- Fira Sans

See font installation instructions in [[file:config/fonts.org][Doom Emacs > Fonts]].

** Installation
You'll need to execute two commands in order to get this configuration setup. Firstly you'll need to clone the project and then run the =make= command in order to compile and execute ~doom sync~.

*Important*: Be sure to back up your previous configuration.

#+begin_example sh
$ git clone https://github.com/desyncr/.doom.d ~/.config/doom
$ cd ~/.config/doom
$ make
#+end_example

* Organisation
** Look and Feel
Fonts, Themes, Icons and such. This section (and subsections) are related to look and feel configuration options and packages.

Ideally if this configuration doesn't load or I intentionally disable it the overall Emacs workflow should remain intact. Meaning that I could work almost as normal.

*** [[file:config/ui.org][Doom Emacs > UI]]
*** [[file:config/fonts.org][Doom Emacs > Fonts]]

** Workflow
*** [[file:config/keybindings.org][Doom Emacs > Keybindings]]
Keybindings for common commands and shortcuts for different operations as well and bindings for specific packages should be here.

*** [[file:config/coding.org][Doom Emacs > Coding]]
Programming related packages and configuration settings go here. Primarly sorrounding LSP-mode and related.

** Projects
*** [[file:config/version-control.org][Doom Emacs > Version Control]]
Section sorrounding Git and Magit configuration and options. Nothing else is required anyways.

*** [[file:config/project-management.org][Doom Emacs > Project Management]]
Configuration related to how to work around projects, workspaces, bookmarks and moving around the file system.

*** [[file:config/org-everything.org][Doom Emacs > Org Everything]]
Org related configuration, including a miriad of org-related packages such as org-roam, org-agenda, org-tasks etc.

** Packages
*** [[file:config/packages.org][Doom Emacs > Packages]]

** General
*** [[file:config/general.org][Doom Emacs > General]]
*** [[file:config/other.org][Doom Emacs > Other]]
General purpose  section for tools I'm trying out or doesn't fit any other category.

*** [[file:config/writing.org][Doom Emacs > Writing]]
Section for prose writing related configurations. This section is rarely updated.
